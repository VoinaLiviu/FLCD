Node:
    * class for representing the nodes of a BST

    * attributes:
        value -> the value that the node contains
        left  -> the node on the left
        right -> the node on the right

    * methods:
        getValue -> gets the value from the node
        getLeft  -> gets the node from the left
        getRight -> gets the node from the right
        setValue -> sets the value from the node
        setLeft  -> sets the node from the left
        setRight -> sets the node from the right

BST:
    * class for representing a Binary Search Tree

    * attributes:
        root -> the root of the tree (the node on top of the tree)

    * methods:
        insert              -> inserts a value into the BST based on the standard BST rules
        search              -> searches a value into the BST
        printAlphabetically -> prints all the values from the BST in alphabetical order
        print               -> wrapper method for printAlphabetically

SymbolTable:
    * class for representing a symbol table

    * attributes:
        bst      -> the Binary Search Tree in which the symbol table values are going to be stored
        position -> the last position from the symbol table (initialized with 0)

    * methods:
        add       -> adds a value to the symbol table
        alreadyIn -> verifies if a value already exists in the symbol table
        search    -> searches a value in the symbol table
        print     -> prints the values from the symbol table
